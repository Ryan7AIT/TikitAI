That's... not something we directly handle in DATAFIRST. We're really focused on the sales and promotion side of things, not the technical integration with things like Web3 or GPS data itself.   DATAFIRST doesn't have any built-in features for that, unfortunately. You'd be looking at integrating DATAFIRST *with* a Web3 platform or GPS service, and that's outside of what I usually support.  Hmm, I haven't seen that one before. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to do? Maybe I can point you in the right direction, even if it's not directly *in* the app. What's the overall goal here?
