Just to make sure I'm on the same page, you'd like to know how it works and how to use it, is that right? \n\nNo problem, I've got you covered!\n\nBasically, you set an overall objective for the year, then break it down by month, region, sector, and route. The key part is choosing a **breakdown type**: either **per family** (using predefined product families) or **per superfamily** (creating your own superfamilies with multiple families). You then assign percentages to each family or superfamily. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of how to use it:\n\n1.  Go to the objectives page.\n2.  Choose whether you want to set objectives based on **SKU** or **CA**.\n3.  Make sure your yearly objective exists (or create one!).\n4.  Set the monthly objective as a percentage of the yearly one.\n5.  Choose your breakdown type: **per family** or **per superfamily**.\n6.  Right-click on the month to set objectives for families or superfamilies.\n7.  If you chose **per family**, you'll see a list of predefined families and can set percentages for each.\n8.  If you chose **per superfamily**, you'll create superfamilies and define objectives for those.\n9.  Finally, check the statistics page, select **Objective per family**, to see how you're doing.\n\nHope that clears it up! Ping me if it's still tricky.
